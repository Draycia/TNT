Class Description:
For all intents and purposes, the Create class is meant to be the interface for
creating new NORI files from suitable bitmap images. It should take in a folder,
an output name, and probably a format version in its constructor.

Dev Notes:
Creating new NORI files is honestly of little use to the Libre Trickster project
and this part of the program is little more than a curiosity.

Development Priority: LOW
